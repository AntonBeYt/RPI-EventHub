Dynamic images (for carousel):
In creating the image carousel, to ammend the issue of 
how determining how large the images will be and the relaive placement of the arrows,
can use the concept of Dynamic Images.
To maintain the aspect ratio based on the largest image, you could potentially use a "ghost" or "dummy" element that serves as a placeholder to push the container to the correct height. However, without knowing the specific aspect ratio or sizes of your images, it's challenging to implement a one-size-fits-all solution here.

If you can determine the aspect ratio of your tallest image, you can use an
invisible element with that ratio to force the container to maintain the height. 
You would add a pseudo-element or an actual element inside .main-image that 
has a padding-top percentage to create the desired aspect ratio. 
This is a "padding-top hack" for creating aspect ratios:
.main-image::before {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  /* Use padding-top to control the height; this example assumes a 4:3 aspect ratio */
  padding-top: 75%; /* This percentage dictates the aspect ratio: height / width * 100% */
}
